# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple project for practicing how to utilize JavaScript for interactive website features. This project was created for the Foundations course in The Odin Project.

Three buttons are displayed on the page, for Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Click any button to start the game, and the computer will randomly choose as well. The number of player and computer wins are tracked, game ends after either reach five wins.
